# Lingo
Lingo is a lightweight and extensible localization (i18n) library for Minecraft plugins, developed by the [SnorlaxLabs Team](https://snorlaxlabs.de) for [RelaxoGamesDE](https://relaxogames.de).

It provides a centralized language management system by resolving player locale settings through a database-backed lookup. This allows plugins to dynamically deliver translated messages based on individual player preferences.
## Features

- Database-driven locale resolution per player
- Fast, lightweight, and dependency-friendly design
- API-oriented and easy to integrate into existing plugins
- Supports runtime language switching
- Thread-safe access for asynchronous operations and efficient pool management [(HikariCP)](https://www.baeldung.com/hikaricp)
